# Stuff I want to do eventually for this

[ ] Add a blog-type thing
[ ] Host game releases here (on separate page? Or link to from projects page?)
[ ] Finally finish setting up CI/CD w/ github actions
[ ] Move to gitlab after portfolio project is graded?
[ ] Setup page of shame
[ ] Make more professional
[ ] Actually finish a project that I'm happy with, so there's stuff to be professional about
[ ] Repo-external large binary file storage? (right now using git-lfs)
